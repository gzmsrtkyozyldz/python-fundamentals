# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a //b .
# The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.
# Example
# a=3
# b=5
# The result of the integer division 3 // 5 = 0
# The result of the float division is 3 / 5 = 0.6
a = int(input('please enter a number:'))
b = int(input('Please enter a number:'))

print(a // b)
print(a / b)
